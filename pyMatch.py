pyMatch Component --> Template Matching in Python

This python script uses MRtools to read in a nifti image template (Data class), and match
a list of user specified images to the template (Match class).  Usage could be to match
components (individual functional networks) from an individual ica analysis to the 
most similar component from a group ica (group networks) analysis, OR to match a group 
significant result from one modality to group networks.  The images used for matching
will first be filtered (getting rid of high frequency components) and then matched.
Inputs should be as follows:

INPUT:
-h, --help      Print this usage
-s --subs=      Single column text file w/ list of subject (or group) folders containing components
-t --template=  The template image to match, such as a group network
-i --images =   Single column text file with a list of component images in folders
-o --output=    Name of output folder.  If not specified, will use pwd

If you input a list of subjects longer than one, keep in mind that each should have the
corresponding component images in the designated folder.  Whether 3D or 4D, the first
timepoint will be used by default to extract data.  If an image's first timepoint is
empty, the script will try the second.  If the second is also empty, it will exit with
error, because there is something wrong with your template or image!

USAGE: python pyMatch.py --subs=sublist.txt --template=/path/to/image.nii.gz --images=imagelist.txt --output=/path/for/outfile

Intended usage is for one template for 1+ subjects/groups with a list of component images.  
Currently only supports matching 3D images (if 4D input, first timepoint will be used)

OUTPUT: (template_name)_bestcomps.txt and (template_name)_beststats.txt w/ top 3 components for each subject/group
